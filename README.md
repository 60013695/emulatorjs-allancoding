When looking through the code, you will see parts that look random like `_0x16a2('0x59','Qz)N')` and `_0x16a2('0x5a','LN43')`

Use the `index.html` file (along with the `index.js` file) to decrypt what it actually means

ONLY WORKS WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF EMULATORJS (In the main repository, not from the official site).

THIS WILL ONLY DECRYPT THE `emulator.js` FILE!! `loader.js` DECRYPTION IS NOT YET SUPPORTED

In this case, this tool will decrypt `_0x16a2('0x59','Qz)N')` to `prototype` and  `_0x16a2('0x5a','LN43')` to `getType`
